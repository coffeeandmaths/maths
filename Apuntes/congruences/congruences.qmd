## Preliminaries

## Structured Sets vs Arbitrary Sets

Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ be an arbitrary finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$. This set is defined purely by selection and carries no inherent structure beyond its elements.

In contrast, consider the quotient:
$$
\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{[0], [1], \dots, [n-1]\}
$$

This set arises not by arbitrary choice, but by **partitioning the infinite set $\mathbb{Z}$** using the equivalence relation:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n} \;\; \Longleftrightarrow \;\; n \mid (a - b)
$$

Each element $[r]$ in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ represents an **equivalence class**:
$$
[n]_r := \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv r \pmod{n}\}
$$

Thus:

- The set $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is **finite**, but derived structurally from an **infinite** source.
- The modulus $n$ acts as a **delimiting framework**, not by exclusion, but by compressing $\mathbb{Z}$ into $n$ structural positions.
- The result is a set equipped with canonical operations (addition and multiplication of classes), forming a **ring** (or a field if $n$ is prime).

This reflects a shift from thinking of finite sets as *collections* to seeing them as *quotients* — as **compressed structural spaces** derived from deeper algebraic relations.

## Structural Interpretation of Congruence via Divisibility

## First approach

Applying the congruence mod $n$ is structurally equivalent to removing the mask $k$ from an expression of the form $a = b + kn$. What remains after reduction is the underlying component that reveals whether two integers belong to the same structural layer defined by $n$. Congruence identifies elements of $\mathbb{Z}$ whose difference lies entirely in $n\mathbb{Z}$. The multiple $k$ carries no algebraic identity — it is a shift, a disguise.  The operation mod $n$ discards this displacement and retains only the structural residue: the unique representative of the equivalence class in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$. For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, define:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n} \;\; \Longleftrightarrow \;\; a - b = kn \text{ for some } k \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

The number $k$ carries no structural significance; it merely indicates the number of steps between $a$ and $b$ along a fixed scale of $n$. What matters is that the difference between $a$ and $b$ lies entirely within the additive subgroup $n\mathbb{Z}$.

Thus, we treat $a$ and $b$ as equivalent not because of their numerical values, but because they are separated by a quantity constructed entirely from the structural unit $n$. The congruence relation $\equiv \pmod{n}$ classifies elements of $\mathbb{Z}$ according to their position modulo this fixed unit, ignoring how far apart they are along the $n$-grid.

This induces a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into equivalence classes:
$$
[a]_n = \{ a + kn \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$

Each class captures the set of integers that differ from $a$ by a quantity divisible by $n$. The structure of modular arithmetic arises from identifying such elements and operating directly on their classes. The modulus $n$ determines the grid; the multiples $kn$ merely shift within it.



Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$. For each $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, the congruence relation $\equiv \pmod{n}$ partitions $\mathbb{Z}$ into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes.

Each class is defined by its representative $r \in \{0, 1, \dots, n - 1\}$, where:
$$
[a]_n = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv a \pmod{n} \}
= \{ a + kn \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$

The set of all such distinct classes forms the quotient:
$$
\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{ [0], [1], \dots, [n - 1] \}
$$

Each integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ belongs to exactly one class, determined by its remainder when divided by $n$. The congruence relation thus groups together all integers with the same remainder modulo $n$ and assigns them to a unique equivalence class $[r]_n$.

## Structural Interpretation with Indexing

Let $n \in \mathbb{N},\, n \geq 1$. The modulus $n$ defines a structural framework on $\mathbb{Z}$ by partitioning it into $n$ disjoint equivalence classes under the relation:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n} \;\; \Longleftrightarrow \;\; n \mid (a - b)
$$

Each class is determined by a unique invariant $r \in \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$, which is the remainder of any representative modulo $n$. We denote the class structurally by:
$$
[n]_r := \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv r \pmod{n} \}
$$

Here:
- $n$ acts as the **structural base**, setting the modular framework.
- $r$ is the **invariant label**, identifying the equivalence class within that structure.

This notation emphasizes that elements of the same class differ only by integer multiples of $n$, and their essential identity within the system is captured entirely by the invariant $r$. The quotient structure $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ may then be viewed as the set of all such structurally indexed classes:
$$
\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{ [n]_0, [n]_1, \dots, [n]_{n-1} \}
$$

This reframing decouples the class from any arbitrary representative and instead roots it in its defining invariant within the structure imposed by $n$.


## 🔧 Solvability Condition for Linear Congruences

Consider the congruence:
$$
ax \equiv b \pmod{n}
$$

This is solvable if and only if:
$$
\gcd(a, n) \mid b
$$

---

## 🎯 Reformulation as a Diophantine Equation

The congruence $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$ means:
$$
n \mid (ax - b)
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
ax - b = kn \quad \text{for some } k \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

Rewriting:
$$
ax - kn = b
$$

This is a **linear Diophantine equation** in the integers $x$ and $k$:
$$
a x + (-n)k = b
$$

---

## 📐 Diophantine Equation: General Form

A linear Diophantine equation is an equation of the form:
$$
a x + n y = b
$$
where $a, n, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we seek **integer solutions** $(x, y)$.

### 🔹 Fundamental Theorem:
The equation $a x + n y = b$ has integer solutions if and only if:
$$
\gcd(a, n) \mid b
$$

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

Thus, the congruence $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$ is solvable if and only if the Diophantine equation
$$
ax + (-n)k = b
$$
has integer solutions. This occurs precisely when:
$$
\boxed{\gcd(a, n) \mid b}
$$

If this condition holds, we may simplify the congruence and solve using modular inverses.


## 🔢 Euclidean Algorithm – Formal Shortcut Format

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $a > b > 0$. Perform successive divisions:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
a \div b &=& q_1 \Rightarrow r_1 \\
b \div r_1 &=& q_2 \Rightarrow r_2 \\
r_1 \div r_2 &=& q_3 \Rightarrow r_3 \\
&\vdots& \\
r_{n-2} \div r_{n-1} &=& q_n \Rightarrow r_n \\
r_{n-1} \div r_n &=& q_{n+1} \Rightarrow 0
\end{array}
$$

Then:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = r_n
$$

---

### 📘 Example: Compute $\gcd(544,\ 119)$

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
544 \div 119 &=& 4 \Rightarrow 68 \\
119 \div 68  &=& 1 \Rightarrow 51 \\
68 \div 51   &=& 1 \Rightarrow 17 \\
51 \div 17   &=& 3 \Rightarrow 0
\end{array}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\gcd(544,\ 119) = \boxed{17}
$$


## Euclidean Algorithm (Formal)

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $a \geq b > 0$. Perform successive divisions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= bq_1 + r_1,\quad &0 \leq r_1 < b \\
b &= r_1q_2 + r_2,\quad &0 \leq r_2 < r_1 \\
r_1 &= r_2q_3 + r_3,\quad &0 \leq r_3 < r_2 \\
&\vdots \\
r_{n-2} &= r_{n-1}q_n + r_n,\quad &0 \leq r_n < r_{n-1} \\
r_{n-1} &= r_n q_{n+1} + 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = r_n
$$

### Example

Compute $\gcd(252, 105)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
252 &= 105 \cdot 2 + 42 \\
105 &= 42 \cdot 2 + 21 \\
42 &= 21 \cdot 2 + 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence:

$$
\gcd(252, 105) = \boxed{21}
$$


Let $n \in \mathbb{N},\; n \geq 1$. For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, define:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n} \;\; \Leftrightarrow \;\; n \mid (a - b)
$$

This defines an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$. The set of equivalence classes is denoted $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Each class contains all integers congruent modulo $n$:
$$
[a]_n = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv a \pmod{n} \}
$$

We define operations:
$$
[a] + [b] := [a + b], \quad [a][b] := [ab]
$$

These are well-defined. The structure $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring with identity. If $n$ is prime, it is a field.

## Algebraic Rules for Congruences

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$. Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n}, \quad c \equiv d \pmod{n}
$$

Then:

### Addition:
$$
a + c \equiv b + d \pmod{n}
$$

### Subtraction:
$$
a - c \equiv b - d \pmod{n}
$$

### Multiplication:
$$
ac \equiv bd \pmod{n}
$$

### Exponentiation:
$$
a^k \equiv b^k \pmod{n} \quad \text{for all } k \in \mathbb{N}
$$

### Substitution:
If $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$, then $a$ may be replaced by $b$ in any modular expression.

### Cancellation:
If $ac \equiv bc \pmod{n}$ and $\gcd(c, n) = 1$, then:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n}
$$

Otherwise, cancellation is not valid.

## Framework and Assumptions

Throughout, fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$. All congruences are understood modulo $n$.

We regard congruence modulo $n$ as a binary relation on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined by:
$$
a \equiv b \pmod{n} \iff n \mid (a - b)
$$

This relation is taken as an equivalence relation. The algebraic rules below are presented without proof, and will be treated as formal properties of the quotient structure $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Their justification will be provided subsequently through direct argument or structural reasoning.
