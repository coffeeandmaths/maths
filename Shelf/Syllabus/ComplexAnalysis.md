# ‚ú® **Tips for Success**

- **Practice**: Complex analysis is best learned by solving lots of problems (proofs, computations, mappings).
    
- **Geometric intuition**: Always visualize mappings (e.g., circles to lines, etc.).
    
- **Foundations first**: Don‚Äôt rush into residues without understanding Cauchy‚Äôs theorem properly.
    
- **Office hours / Tutorials**: Make sure to ask questions if anything about convergence or singularities feels vague.
