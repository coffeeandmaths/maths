# 🧠 From Intuition to Formalism: Micro-Review Checklist

A structured routine to move from intuitive understanding to formal fluency using *Aluffi – Algebra: Chapter 0* as your core guide.

---

## ✅ 1. Concept Digestion (as you already do)

- [ ] Read the section from Aluffi slowly and attentively.
- [ ] Write a **brief summary in your own words** (1–3 lines max).
- [ ] Ask: _“What core idea is being protected or clarified by this concept?”_

---

## ✅ 2. Formal Encoding

- [ ] Translate the concept into **set-theoretic or logical form**.
- [ ] Identify and annotate key symbolic structures (e.g., why `S × {0}`, tagging, unions).
- [ ] Ask: _“Why is this formal version necessary?”_

---

## ✅ 3. Comparison

- [ ] Write your **intuition** and Aluffi’s **formal version** side by side.
- [ ] Note what is **preserved or clarified** by the formalism.
- [ ] Reflect: _“What does the formalism prevent or guarantee?”_

---

## ✅ 4. Use in a Simple Proof

- [ ] Find a proposition that **uses** the concept.
- [ ] Sketch a **proof using only the definition**, not your intuition.
- [ ] Rephrase the proposition using your own notation or version.

---

## ✅ 5. Write Your Own

- [ ] Create a **simple example** (e.g., disjoint union of sets).
- [ ] Write the **formal definition** from scratch.
- [ ] Compare to Aluffi’s definition and adjust if needed.

## 🛠 Weekly Reassurance Check

Ask yourself:
- [ ] _“Can I explain this concept in one sentence to a beginner?”_
- [ ] _“Can I write it fully in formal notation for a theorist?”_

If both are **yes**, the concept is internalized.  
If **not yet**, revisit the steps above.
