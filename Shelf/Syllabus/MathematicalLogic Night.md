## ‚ú® Tips

- Don‚Äôt worry if parts feel dense‚ÄîShoenfield is formal but well structured.
- Margin summaries or a mini glossary will help retain syntax/semantics.
- Try to prove basic lemmas from memory after reading each section.

Happy logic reading! This plan will make your algebraic and analytic thinking sharper and more formalized.
