# 📘 Standalone Real Analysis Study Plan (40 Weeks)

## 🎯 Overview

**Core Objective:**  
Master the foundations of real analysis through rigorous definitions, proofs, and examples.

**Primary Approach:**  
Formal definitions first, followed by applications and exercises.

**Note:**  
This is an independent track, not integrated with abstract algebra — it develops parallel logical fluency.
