# 🏆 Strategy to Prepare

- Spend **6–8 weeks** before the semester reviewing proofs and real analysis.
    
- During the Complex Analysis semester, dedicate **30% of study time to proofs** (especially for theorems like Cauchy's, Laurent's, Rouche's).
    
- **Write** full detailed proofs by hand, not just read them.
    
- Treat "proof writing" like "problem solving" — each proof is a problem to solve.

# 🛠️ 5. **How to Study per Problem (Method)**

For every problem you study:

1. **Understand the problem deeply.**
    
2. **Think of multiple solutions.**
    
3. **Estimate time and space complexity.**
    
4. **Draw diagrams or dry-run on paper.**
    
5. **Write Pseudocode FIRST.**
    
6. **Only then code it (C or Python).**
    
7. **Reflect**: Could it be improved?

# ✅ In Short:

|Focus|Action|
|---|---|
|Tools|Pseudocode, Flowcharts, Big-O analysis|
|Books|CLRS, Grokking Algorithms, Skiena|
|Resources|Project Euler, LeetCode|
|Visuals|Hand-draw trees, graphs, recursion|
|Semester Plan|15 weeks structured learning|

# 🎯 First: A **Simple Flowchart Example** (Binary Search)

🔵 **Problem**: Find a number in a sorted array using Binary Search.

🔵 **Visual Flowchart**:
```

 [Start]
    ↓
 [Set low = 0, high = n-1]
    ↓
 [While low <= high]
    ↓
 [Compute mid = (low + high) / 2]
    ↓
[Is arr[mid] == target?] → Yes → [Return mid] → [End]
           ↓ No
[Is arr[mid] < target?]
   ↓                   ↓
 Yes                   No
[low = mid + 1]    [high = mid - 1]
    ↓                  ↓
    └────── Loop back to [While low <= high]

```

# 🧠 Now: **Pseudocode: How to write it like a pro**

---
## 🛠️ 1. Good Style Tips for Writing Pseudocode:

- ✅ Use simple English mixed with logical structure (`if`, `while`, `for`).
    
- ✅ No need to worry about syntax (`{}` or `:` or semicolons `;`).
    
- ✅ Use meaningful variable names (`low`, `high`, `sum`, `index`).
    
- ✅ Indent blocks to show logic depth.
    
- ✅ Write comments for key decisions.

### 🔥 Example of Clean Pseudocode (Binary Search)

```
Function binarySearch(arr, target)
    Set low = 0
    Set high = length of arr - 1

    While low <= high
        Set mid = (low + high) / 2

        If arr[mid] == target
            Return mid

        Else if arr[mid] < target
            Set low = mid + 1

        Else
            Set high = mid - 1

    Return -1  // Target not found

```

# 📚 2. Best Resources to Learn Pseudocode

### 📖 Easy and Visual

|Resource|Why it's good|
|---|---|
|**"Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava**|Visual style, pseudocode before real code. Very beginner-friendly.|
|**VisuAlgo.net**|Shows visual animations + pseudocode for algorithms.|
|**Coursera: Princeton Algorithms Part I**|Lectures use clear pseudocode first, then real code.|

## 📝 Ultimate Algorithm Development Checklist

## 1. **Understand the Problem (NO coding yet)**

- 🔲 Read the problem _twice_ slowly.
    
- 🔲 Identify **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
    
- 🔲 Clarify **Constraints** (size limits, value limits, etc.).
    
- 🔲 Note **Edge Cases** (empty inputs? negatives? duplicates?).
    

---

## 2. **Plan a Solution (on Paper / Mind)**

- 🔲 Write a **brief English explanation** of what you think the solution idea is.
    
- 🔲 Draw a **small example manually** (even 3–5 elements).
    
- 🔲 If complex, **draw a flowchart** or **state diagram**.
    
- 🔲 Think: Is it **brute force**? Can it be **optimized**?
    

---

## 3. **Write Pseudocode (clean and readable)**

- 🔲 Use plain English mixed with structured keywords (`if`, `while`, `for`).
    
- 🔲 Focus on **logic**, not syntax.
    
- 🔲 Indent steps properly.
    
- 🔲 Add 1–2 short **comments** explaining key parts.
    

---

## 4. **Analyze Complexity (Big-O Thinking)**

- 🔲 What's the **Time Complexity**? (O(n), O(n²), O(log n)...)
    
- 🔲 What's the **Space Complexity**?
    
- 🔲 Is it acceptable for given problem constraints?
    

---

## 5. **Code the Solution (only now!)**

- 🔲 Translate pseudocode into real code **carefully**.
    
- 🔲 Use small, meaningful variable names.
    
- 🔲 Keep functions **small** and **focused**.
    

---

## 6. **Test Thoroughly**

- 🔲 Test with **small examples** first.
    
- 🔲 Test with **large inputs** if possible.
    
- 🔲 Test **edge cases** (empty, huge numbers, wrong formats).
    

---

## 7. **Reflect and Optimize**

- 🔲 Could the solution be **simpler** or **faster**?
    
- 🔲 Is memory usage **reasonable**?
    
- 🔲 Could recursion become iteration (if stack overflow risk)?

# 🧠 _Pro Tip:_

Keep a small notebook or digital journal where you record each algorithm you solve like this:

|Problem|Idea|Pseudocode|Complexity|Reflection|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Binary Search|Divide sorted array|(Pseudocode)|O(log n)|Very efficient. Can use recursion too.|

You will build a personal **"algorithmic thinking library"** over time. 🚀
