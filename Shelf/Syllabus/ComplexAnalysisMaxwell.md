# 🧠 One-Year Self-Study Syllabus: Mathematical Foundations of Physics

## 🌟 Course Philosophy

This course sits at the intersection of **pure mathematics** and **analytical applications**. It is designed for those who wish to remain rooted in rigorous mathematical thinking while exploring how mathematics structures and explains key physical phenomena. Applications like differential equations and electromagnetism are treated not as engineering tools, but as gateways to deeper mathematical understanding.

The aim is not to become an applied mathematician or physicist, but to explore how the language of mathematics reveals the unity and structure of natural laws, particularly through **Maxwell’s equations** and the **analytic theory of functions**. Proof-writing is a central pillar: throughout the course, formal proof construction, analysis, and critique are embedded in every topic.

This course is a mathematically rigorous program designed to explore how deep theory informs both abstract structures and physical laws. The emphasis is on **understanding over computation**, **proof over memorization**, and **clarity over shortcuts**. Welcome to the frontier where proofs, analysis, and natural laws converge through mathematics.
