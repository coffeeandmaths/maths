# ðŸ“˜ Companion Reading Guide: Set Theory with Aluffi Chapter 1

This guide pairs specific chapters and sections from **Goldrei's _Classic Set Theory_** and **Halmos' _Naive Set Theory_** with Aluffi's Chapter 1. The goal is to reinforce foundational set-theoretic ideas with full structural clarity, without diverging from Aluffiâ€™s mathematical maturity.

## ðŸ“˜ Suggested Study Strategy

### Phase 1: Inclusion & Subsets
- Aluffi Â§1.1
- **Goldrei** Ch. 2â€“3 â†’ Definitions, power sets, visual intuition
- **Halmos** Ch. 1 â†’ Crisp foundations, ideal warm-up

### Phase 2: Disjoint Unions
- Aluffi Â§1.3
- **Goldrei** Ch. 7 â†’ Indexed unions and labeled copies
- **Halmos** Ch. 3 â†’ Simpler, skimmable

### Phase 3: Products & Family Notation
- Aluffi Â§1.4
- **Goldrei** Ch. 8 â†’ General product sets, tuples, function view
- **Halmos** Ch. 4 â†’ Short and clean intro

### Phase 4: Equivalence & Partition
- Aluffi Â§1.5
- **Goldrei** Ch. 6 (esp. pp. 66â€“75) â†’ Equivalence, classes, partitions
- **Halmos** Ch. 8 â†’ Strong high-level summary

### Phase 5: Functions (to prepare for Â§1.6)
- Aluffi Â§1.6
- **Goldrei** Ch. 5 â†’ Injections, surjections, images
- **Halmos** Ch. 5 â†’ Matches Aluffiâ€™s tone and structure

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Skip Goldrei's logic-heavy opening if you're focused on sets, not formal logic
- Donâ€™t worry if Halmos feels fastâ€”itâ€™s meant to be read multiple times
- Goldrei is exercise-rich and excellent for reinforcing proofs
