# ðŸ§  1-Year Algorithm & Logic Mastery Syllabus (C-first, Python-second)

**Purpose**: Build deep algorithmic thinking using C (primary), with optional Python translation for deployment/job-readiness. No reliance on IDEs, no fluff. Jupyter optional for Python.

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Philosophy
- **Primary Language**: C (classic, minimal, deterministic)
- **Optional Deployment**: Python 3 (vanilla, no libraries)
- **Tools**: GCC, make, Jupyter (for Python), paper + pen for pseudocode
- **Approach**: Solve each problem through 6 steps:
  1. Understand problem fully (inputs/outputs/constraints)
  2. Draw diagrams (flowcharts, trees, tables)
  3. Write clean pseudocode
  4. Analyze complexity (Big-O)
  5. Implement in C
  6. (Optional) Translate to Python

## ðŸ“˜ Reflection Journal Format
For each solved problem, record:

```markdown
Problem: Find Max in Array
- **Idea**: Loop through, track max
- **Pseudocode**: (written)
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **C Implementation**: (attached)
- **Python (optional)**: (notebook link)
- **Reflection**: Could use divide & conquer
```
