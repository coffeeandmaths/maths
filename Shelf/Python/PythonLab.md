## 📦 Phase 1 – Foundations & CLI Projects (Weeks 1–12)

- [ ] **Week 01:** Install Python, Learn Variables & Strings (Ch. 1–2)  
    🔧  _Lab_: Create a CLI script that takes your name and greets you. Use `input()` and formatted strings. Store output in a `.txt` log.
    
- **Week 02:** Lists & Loops (Ch. 3–4)  
    🔧  _Lab_: Shopping List Manager using list operations and `while True` loop. Add/remove/view items, use `break` to exit.
    
- **Week 03:** Conditionals (Ch. 5)  
    🔧  _Lab_: Number Guessing Game. Use random number generation and nested if-statements to add levels.
    
- **Week 04:** Dictionaries (Ch. 6)  
    🔧  _Lab_: Contact Book. Use dictionaries to store and retrieve name, email, phone. Extend with JSON export.
    
- ✏️ **Week 05:** While loops, flags, input (Ch. 7)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Poll Collector. Build a CLI polling app that prompts multiple users for a response to a single question. Store the results in a dictionary with usernames as keys and answers as values. Append the results to a JSON or plain text file for persistence.
    
- ✏️ **Week 06:** Functions (Ch. 8)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Tip Calculator. Modular CLI program that accepts input (bill total, tip %) and computes the final amount. Structure logic with 2–3 reusable functions.
    
-  **Week 07:** Lists/dicts in functions (Ch. 8–9)  
    🔧 _Lab_: RPG Character Builder. Allow the user to choose from a list of character classes (dicts of stats). Use functions to assign skill points and return the character sheet.
    
-  **Week 08:** OOP Basics (Ch. 9)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Pet Model. Create a `Pet` base class and subclasses like `Dog`, `Cat`. Each should have a name and species, and define a `speak()` method.
    
-  **Week 09:** Inheritance, Modules (Ch. 9–10)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Character Battle Simulator. Inherit from a base `Character` class to create `Wizard`, `Fighter`. Use `random` and damage formulas. Build as an importable module.
    
-  **Week 10:** Exceptions, File I/O (Ch. 10)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Text File Merger. Accept multiple `.txt` filenames from the user. Use `try/except` to handle missing files and combine contents into a master output.
    
-  **Week 11:** JSON persistence (Ch. 10)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Favorite Number App. Save a number to a JSON file and retrieve it next run. Use `try/except` and check if the number is already stored.
    
-  **Week 12:** Review + Final CLI Mini-Project  
    🔧 _Lab_: Text-Based Adventure Game. Design a multi-room scenario. Use functions for rooms, conditionals for logic, and classes for player/inventory. Store rooms in a dictionary.

## 🚀 Phase 2 – Intermediate + PCAP Prep (Weeks 13–24)

-  **Week 13:** `unittest` (Ch. 11)  
    🔧 _Lab_: Add test cases to your Tip Calculator and Contact Book with `unittest.TestCase`. Ensure input validation and function isolation.
    
-  **Week 14:** Polish CLI tools. Upload to GitHub with README and screenshots.
    
-  **Week 15:** PCAP Module 1 – Basics & Arithmetic Ops
    
-  **Week 16:** PCAP Module 2 – Control Flow  
    🔧 _Lab_: CLI Quiz App. Load questions from a list. Ask 5 questions with score tracking. Randomize questions.
    
-  **Week 17:** PCAP Module 3 – Functions
    
-  **Week 18:** PCAP Module 4 – Collections (Lists, Tuples, Sets)  
    🔧 _Lab_: CSV sorter. Read a CSV file of contacts, sort alphabetically by last name, and output to a new CSV.
    
-  **Week 19:** PCAP Module 5 – Strings, RegEx  
    🔧 _Lab_: Email Extractor. Given `.txt` files, use `re.findall()` to extract all email addresses and save them to a file.
    
-  **Week 20:** PCAP Module 6 – OOP Review  
    🔧 _Lab_: Product Inventory Tracker. Model products as objects with price, quantity, and value. Print reports using formatted strings.
    
-  **Week 21:** PCAP Module 7 – Modules
    
-  **Week 22:** PCAP Module 8 – File I/O & Exceptions
    
-  **Week 23:** PCAP Module 9 – Review All Topics
    
-  **Week 24:** Take 2 full PCAP Practice Tests with review
