## üìÖ Yearly Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundations of Problem Solving (Weeks 1‚Äì10)

#### üìå Side Topic: What is a Dry Run?

A **dry run** is the manual execution of an algorithm step-by-step with specific inputs, often done on paper or in a table. It helps understand how variables change, how logic flows, and whether the algorithm works as intended.

**Example**: Dry run of linear search on A = [4, 7, 9, 2] with target = 9

|i|A[i]|A[i] == target?|
|---|---|---|
|0|4|No|
|1|7|No|
|2|9|**Yes ‚Üí return 2**|

Use dry runs often to test logic before coding or formalizing an idea.
