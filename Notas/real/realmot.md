While reading university syllabi — particularly from the Cambridge Tripos — I realized that my interest in algebra naturally led to further questions about the structure of number systems. I found myself asking:  

> *What exactly is a number? How is an irrational number constructed?*

This led me to **real calculus**. I wanted to understand the real number system with the same depth and precision I was applying to abstract algebra. I believe the two areas are deeply connected — algebraic structure and analytical construction — and that exploring both in parallel will illuminate that connection.

This portfolio is the result of that effort: to reconstruct mathematics from the ground up — with clarity, rigor, and personal accountability.
