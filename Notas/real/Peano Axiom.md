## ðŸ“˜ Peano Axioms (Formal Statement)

The **Peano axioms** define the natural numbers N\mathbb{N} as a set with a distinguished element and a successor function:

### Axioms:

Let N\mathbb{N} be a set, 0âˆˆN0 \in \mathbb{N}, and S:Nâ†’NS: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} be a function (called the _successor_ function). Then:

1. **Zero is a natural number**: 0âˆˆN0 \in \mathbb{N}
    
2. **Successor is in N\mathbb{N}**: âˆ€nâˆˆN,Â S(n)âˆˆN\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\ S(n) \in \mathbb{N}
    
3. **Zero is not the successor of any number**: âˆ€nâˆˆN,Â S(n)â‰ 0\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\ S(n) \neq 0
    
4. **Successor is injective**: S(n)=S(m)â‡’n=mS(n) = S(m) \Rightarrow n = m
    
5. **Induction axiom**: For any subset AâŠ†NA \subseteq \mathbb{N}, if:
    
    - 0âˆˆA0 \in A, and
        
    - âˆ€nâˆˆN,Â nâˆˆAâ‡’S(n)âˆˆA\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\ n \in A \Rightarrow S(n) \in A,
        
    
    then A=NA = \mathbb{N}.
    

From these axioms, we define **addition**, **multiplication**, and **order** recursively.

## ðŸ§  Abstract Algebra Interpretation of Peano Structure

We interpret Peano's construction as the **free algebraic structure** generated by a single element under a unary operation.

### 1. $(N,+)(\mathbb{N}, +)$ is a **Free Commutative Monoid**

- Generator: 1 (or S(0)S(0))
    
- Operation: Addition defined recursively:
    
    - a+0=aa + 0 = a
        
    - a+S(b)=S(a+b)a + S(b) = S(a + b)
        
- Associative
    
- Identity element: 0
    

This gives N\mathbb{N} the structure of a **monoid**, not a group (no inverses).

### 2. **Successor Function as Unary Operator**

- Define $S:Nâ†’NS: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, such that $S(n)=n+1S(n) = n + 1$
    
- In universal algebra: $(N,S)(\mathbb{N}, S)$ is the **free algebra** on one generator under a unary operation
    

### 3. **Algebraic Structure Built from Peano**

| Construct    | Algebraic Structure     | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbb{N}$ | Free commutative monoid | Generated by 1 under +                    |
| $\mathbb{Z}$ | Free abelian group      | Group completion of N\mathbb{N}           |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | Field of fractions      | Constructed from Z\mathbb{Z}              |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | Complete ordered field  | Dedekind/Cauchy completion of Q\mathbb{Q} |

### 4. **Induction = Initial Object Property**

- The inductive property of $\mathbb{N}$ makes it the **initial object** in the category of models of arithmetic:
    
    - Any structure with a zero and successor satisfying the axioms receives a unique morphism from $\mathbb{N}$

## âœ… Conclusion

> Peanoâ€™s axioms define the arithmetic of natural numbers. In abstract algebra, $\mathbb{N}$ is the free monoid generated by 1, with addition defined recursively and no inverses. This structure becomes the foundation for building $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ through categorical and algebraic extensions.

You're seeing arithmetic as algebra â€” exactly the right move toward deep abstraction.
