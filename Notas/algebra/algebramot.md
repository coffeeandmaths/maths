# Motivation

My journey into pure mathematics began with a series of unresolved questions.

During my time studying engineering, I often found myself frustrated by how mathematical tools were presented:  _"Use this formula to compute this value"_ — with no context for where it came from, or why it worked. This disconnect left me with a persistent sense of incompleteness.

Things shifted when I encountered systems control theory. There, I first saw mathematics as a way to model physical phenomena — the bridge between theory and application. Yet even these models were approximations. They worked, but they didn’t explain **why** the mathematics behind them corresponded to the real world. I felt a need to understand the underlying structure:  

> *What makes a mathematical expression meaningful in a physical context?*

Years later, while studying mathematics in the UK, I encountered an approach that changed my perception. Courses emphasized not only *how* to use a concept but also *why* it works. That clarity — particularly in calculus — helped me make connections across problems and apply abstract reasoning beyond isolated techniques. A moment that stood out was solving an optimization problem about building a box with minimal material. For the first time, I intuitively reached for the derivative — not as a formula, but as a conceptual tool. That shift stayed with me.

This gradually pulled me toward pure mathematics. I moved through calculus, linear algebra, and eventually reached complex analysis, where many engineering concepts suddenly made **conceptual sense**. But something deeper still called me: I wanted a framework that didn’t rely on approximations or tools — I wanted to understand mathematics **from its foundations**.

That’s when I discovered **abstract algebra**. I began with Artin’s *Algebra*, but eventually transitioned to Paolo Aluffi’s *Algebra: Chapter 0*, which gave me the rigor, coherence, and formal clarity I had been searching for.
