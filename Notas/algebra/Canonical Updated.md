## ðŸ§  Two Perspectives on Functions: Pointwise vs Canonical

Understanding a function can be approached at two conceptual levels â€” a **pointwise (groupal)** view and a **canonical (structural)** view. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Pointwise / Groupal View

- **Focus**:  
  Individual values â€” evaluating input-output pairs  
  $$ f: A \to B, \quad f(a) = b $$

- **Behavior**:  
  Treats the function as a rule to compute or observe  
  "Given this input, what is the output?"

- **Example**:  
  $f(a) = a \bmod n$, where you compute e.g. $f(7) = 2 \bmod 5$ 

- **Scope**:  
  Local, element-by-element

- **Typical Use**:  
  Programming, applied problems, numerical evaluations

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Canonical / Structural View

- **Focus**:  
  The structure that the function imposes on the domain.  
  Understand **how** and **why** it groups elements.

- **Relation Defined by \( f \)**:  
  $$
  a_1 \sim a_2 \iff f(a_1) = f(a_2)
  $$

- **Behavior**:  
  This equivalence partitions the domain into classes  
  based on identical output behavior.

- **Canonical Decomposition**:  
  Every function \( f: A \to B \) factors as:
  $$
  A \xrightarrow{\pi} A/{\sim} \xrightarrow{\tilde{f}} \operatorname{im}(f) \hookrightarrow B
  $$
  - $pi$: canonical surjection (natural projection)  
  - \( \tilde{f} \): bijection between classes and image  
  - \( \hookrightarrow \): injection into codomain

- **Example**:  
  From relation \( a \sim b \iff n \mid (a - b) \), define:  
  $$
  f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, \quad f(a) = [a]_n
  $$
  This is the **canonical projection**.

- **Scope**:  
  Global, structural, abstract

- **Typical Use**:  
  Algebra, category theory, quotient structures, homomorphisms

### ðŸ“Œ Key Differences

| Aspect             | Pointwise / Groupal                 | Canonical / Structural                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| What it gives      | Values \( f(a) \)                    | Equivalence classes and structure             |
| How it sees \( f \)| Mechanism (rule or formula)          | Classification (partition + structure)        |
| Depth              | Surface-level operation              | Deep structure imposed by \( f \)             |
| Perspective        | Element-by-element                   | Class-by-class (quotienting)                  |
| Role of relation   | Often implicit, secondary            | Primary: defines structure via \( \sim \)     |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Summary

The **canonical view** is a "level up" in abstraction. It doesn't care how the function computes,  
but how it **structures** the domain and relates to the codomain. This is essential when:

- Working with quotient sets (e.g. \( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \))  
- Studying group homomorphisms and kernels  
- Understanding the behavior of \( f \) beyond input/output

You go **from computing** to **classifying**.
