# ðŸ“˜ Mathematical Control Theory â€“ One-Year Self-Study Syllabus (Proof-Oriented)

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Objectives

By the end of the course, you should:
- Master the theory of linear time-invariant control systems.
- Use algebraic and analytical tools to model, analyze, and transform systems.
- Connect control theory to real analysis (stability, convergence) and abstract algebra (rings, modules, canonical forms).
- Be prepared for advanced control topics (geometric control, functional analysis, or category-theoretic control).
