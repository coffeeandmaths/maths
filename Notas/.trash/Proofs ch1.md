# üìò Proof Outline ‚Äì Aluffi Chapter 1 (Naive Set Theory)

## 1. Definitions (No Proofs Needed)
- **Set**: A collection of elements.
- **Equality of Sets**: \( A = B \iff \forall x (x \in A \iff x \in B) \)
- **Notation**: Set builder notation, examples like \( \{x \in \mathbb{N} \mid x \text{ even} \} \)

‚úÖ *Just state and internalize clearly. These are foundational axioms or definitions.*

---

## 2. Order is Irrelevant in Sets
### ‚úèÔ∏è Proposition:
If \( A = \{a, b\} \), then \( \{a, b\} = \{b, a\} \)

### ‚úÖ Proof Idea:
Use the **definition of set equality**:
- Show \( \forall x(x \in \{a, b\} \Rightarrow x \in \{b, a\}) \)
- And vice versa.

---

## 3. Inclusion and Subsets
### ‚úèÔ∏è Proposition:
\( A \subseteq B \iff \forall x (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B) \)

‚úÖ *This is a definition but useful to practice its logical manipulation.*

### ‚úèÔ∏è Proposition:
If \( A = B \), then \( A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A \)

### ‚úÖ Proof Idea:
Apply definition of equality of sets ‚Üí double inclusion.

---

## 4. Power Set and Cardinality
### ‚úèÔ∏è Proposition:
The number of elements in \( \mathcal{P}(S) \) is \( 2^{|S|} \)

### ‚úÖ Proof Idea (Finite Case):
- For each element in \( S \), it can either be in or out of a subset.
- Hence, each subset corresponds to a binary string of length \( |S| \).
- Total number of such strings: \( 2^{|S|} \)

---

## üß† Tips While Writing Proofs

- Always **start from definitions**: equality, subset, etc.
- Use **simple cases** to test your proof logic: try \( S = \{a, b\} \)
- Include **remarks** in your notes clarifying:
  - The role of logic (bi-implications, quantifiers)
  - When definitions are being *used* vs *proved*

---

# üß± Structural Approach to Chapter 1 ‚Äì Aluffi (Set Theory Foundations)

## Step 1: First Pass ‚Äì **Surface Scraping**
List all definitions, statements, notations, and examples:
- Definition of set
- Equality of sets
- Order irrelevance
- Notation examples
- Inclusion, subset
- Power set
- Cardinality \( |S| \), \( |\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|} \), etc.

‚úÖ Don‚Äôt filter yet ‚Äî just **list all elements** in order as they appear.

---

## Step 2: Second Pass ‚Äì **Classification Table**

| Statement | Type | Justification |
|----------|------|----------------|
| A set is a collection of elements | **Axiom/Definition** | Starting point, not provable |
| \( A = B \iff \forall x (x \in A \iff x \in B) \) | **Definition** | Defines equality |
| Order of elements in a set is immaterial | **Theorem/Proposition** | Can be proved from definition of equality |
| \( A \subseteq B \iff \forall x (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B) \) | **Definition** | Fundamental |
| \( A = B \iff A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A \) | **Theorem** | Proved using definitions |
| \( |\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|} \) | **Theorem** | Proof uses binary choices per element |
| Notation: \( \mathcal{P}(S), \ 2^S \) | **Notation** | Not provable, just agreed usage |

üîç This table gives you clarity: what to **prove**, what to **assume**, what to **define**, and what to **illustrate**.

---

## Step 3: Proof Writing Begins
Now isolate the ‚Äúprovable‚Äù items and write formal proofs.
Examples:
- \( A = B \iff A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A \)
- \( \{a, b\} = \{b, a\} \)
- \( |\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|} \)

---

## üß† Bonus Tip
You can create a **legend**:
- `üîß Axiom` ‚Äì cannot be proved
- `üìê Definition` ‚Äì base structure
- `üìå Proposition` ‚Äì should be proved
- `‚úèÔ∏è Notation` ‚Äì symbolic shorthand

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Axiom / Postulate** | A fundamental truth accepted without proof. It defines the logical universe in which you're working. | Serves as the *starting point* for all reasoning. All proofs rely on these.                            | Cannot be proved within the system. Often simple but powerful.                                             | "Two sets are equal iff they have the same elements."                  |
| **Definition**   | A formal, precise introduction of a new concept using previously accepted terms or axioms.           | Expands the *vocabulary* of the theory. Essential for communication and construction.                  | Has no truth value (not true or false). Used to fix meaning.                                               | "Let \( A \subseteq B \) mean \( \forall x (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B) \)" |
| **Assumption / Hypothesis** | A temporary condition used within a theorem or proof. Not always globally assumed.                | Sets the *context* of a proposition or proof. Used inside the "if" part.                               | Not a universal truth ‚Äî it holds *within* a particular result or argument.                                | "Assume \( A \subseteq B \) and \( B \subseteq A \)..."                |
| **Lemma**        | A small or technical result used to build bigger theorems.                                            | A *stepping stone* ‚Äî often not interesting on its own but necessary.                                    | Proven rigorously like theorems. Often reused in multiple theorems.                                       | "Transitivity of subset: \( A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq C \Rightarrow A \subseteq C \)" |
| **Proposition**  | A formally stated and proved result of moderate importance.                                           | Develops structure, logic, and consequences. May not be deep, but is often critical.                   | Fully proven using definitions, axioms, and/or lemmas.                                                     | "Two sets are equal iff each is a subset of the other."                |
| **Theorem**      | A major, central result ‚Äî conceptually important or widely applicable.                              | A *cornerstone result* ‚Äî carries weight or insight. May change how the topic is understood.            | Requires rigorous proof. Often synthesizes many lemmas, propositions, and definitions.                    | "For a finite set with \( n \) elements, the number of subsets is \( 2^n \)" |
| **Corollary**    | A direct consequence of a theorem or proposition.                                                    | A *bonus result* ‚Äî follows immediately with minimal additional work.                                    | Proven quickly using the parent theorem.                                                                  | "If \( A = B \), then \( \mathcal{P}(A) = \mathcal{P}(B) \)"           |
| **Remark**       | A comment that clarifies, highlights, or contextualizes a definition or result.                     | Offers *intuition*, connections, or warnings ‚Äî not part of the logical chain.                           | Not a proof step; informal but precise. Helps interpretation.                                              | "Note: \( \emptyset \subseteq A \) for all sets A"                     |
| **Notation**     | Symbolic or syntactic conventions to abbreviate or communicate concepts.                             | Enables *efficient expression* of ideas ‚Äî no mathematical content alone.                               | Must be defined precisely. Abuse of notation is common but must be controlled.                            | \( \mathcal{P}(S) \) for the power set of \( S \); \( |S| \) for cardinality |
