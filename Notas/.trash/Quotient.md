## 🔄 Equivalence Relation: Multiplicative vs Additive Notation

In group theory, we distinguish between:

- **General group theory** (multiplicative notation: $a^{-1}b$)
- **Abelian groups** like $$\mathbb{Z}$$ (additive notation: $$a - b$$)

Let’s clarify.

### 🔹 General Group Case (Multiplicative Notation)

Let $$G$$ be a group (not necessarily abelian). Define an equivalence relation:

$$
a \sim b \iff a^{-1}b \in H
$$

This means: two elements $$a, b \in G$$ are **equivalent** if multiplying $$a^{-1}$$ with $$b$$ lands in the subgroup $$H$$.

**Why $$a^{-1}b$$?**  
Because this expression isolates what you need to "multiply onto $$a$$" to reach $$b$$.  
It measures the "difference" between $$a$$ and $$b$$ via group multiplication.

### 🔹 Abelian Group Case (Additive Notation)

In an additive group (e.g., $$\mathbb{Z}$$ or $$\mathbb{R}$$), group operations are written using addition. So:

- Instead of $$a^{-1}$$, we use $$-a$$
- Instead of $$a^{-1}b$$, we write:

$$
-a + b = b - a
$$

So the equivalence becomes:

$$
a \sim b \iff b - a \in H
$$

Which is also equivalent to:

$$
a \sim b \iff a - b \in H
\quad \text{(since } H \text{ is closed under negatives)}
$$

### 🔁 Mapping the Two Notations

| Multiplicative group (general)   | Additive group (e.g., $$\mathbb{Z}$$)       |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| $$a^{-1}b \in H$$                | $$a - b \in H$$                              |
| $$gH = \{ gh \mid h \in H \}$$   | $$g + H = \{ g + h \mid h \in H \}$$         |

### 🧠 Intuition

- $$a^{-1}b \in H$$ → “To go from $$a$$ to $$b$$, you multiply by something in $$H$$”
- $$a - b \in H$$ → “The difference between $$a$$ and $$b$$ lies in $$H$$”

Both express the same idea:

> “$$a$$ and $$b$$ are equivalent because their relative displacement is inside the subgroup $$H$$”
